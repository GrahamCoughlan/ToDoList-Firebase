This JavaScript project utilises JS and Firebase to create a user todo list that makes each entry unique to the user that enters it and stores their entry onto the user uid on firebase.

This application also has an authentication method that will allow for users to create a private todo list that is unique to them and if the user does not have an account, the ability to 
create an account via email and password is available
